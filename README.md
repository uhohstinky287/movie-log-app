# My Personal Project : Movie and TV Show Ranker

### *A fun way to keep track of, rank and review movies and TV shows*

In this program, users will be able to search through available movies and TV shows, 
or upload one themselves  if unavailable, then write reviews and give ratings to them.
They are then uploaded to a database where other users can see the ratings of other users.

**User Story:**
a user searched up types a movie into the search bar and when it pops up, it shows the movie, 
its description and average rating. The user can also choose to see its written reviews. He can
then rate that movie and write a review where that movie then gets added to his own list of movies he's seen.
