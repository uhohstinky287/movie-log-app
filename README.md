# My Personal Project : Movie and TV Show Ranker

### *A fun way to keep track of, rank and review movies and TV shows*

In this program, users will be able to search through available movies and TV shows, 
or upload one themselves  if unavailable, then write reviews and give ratings to them.
They are then uploaded to a database where other users can see the ratings of other users.

**User Story:**
a user searched up types a movie into the search bar and when it pops up, it shows the movie, 
its description and average rating. The user can also choose to see its written reviews. He can
then rate that movie and write a review where that movie then gets added to his own list of movies he's seen.

- A user can read the description of a movie that he types in
- A user can add a movie to the database if it wasn't already there
- A user can rate the movie
- A user can see the movies that he has rated so far
- A user has the options to save any changes made onto to file
- A user has the option to load their movie list from file


# Instructions for Grader

- first you wil come across a screen with the option to login (load data) or create an account
- Since you don't have an account yet, you should create one (click the create account button)
- type in your username and password, and click create, then ok on the popup, you will see my first visual 
component (a splash screen of sorts that says creating your account that lasts for 3 seconds)
- Once on the Home page you see 2 buttons (Save and Exist without Saving), you can click exit without saving and the
program will exit without saving anything in this session, so for you right now, your account would not be saved 
- The save button saves all changes you made at any point.
- The Second tab on the left, (My Movies), shows you a list of movies you have seen and rated
- Go to the Search Movies Tab where you can search a movie with its exact name and year of release

- Hit search and, it will give details and ask you if you've seen it. Click the button it will ask what you 
rate it /100 and ask if you want to add to your movie list without reviewing it, or review it.
- If you click review, you will be prompted to write a review, and then it'll give you the text area to write.
- Once you hit the add review button, the movie will be saved to your list. You can check this by either searching the
movie again, and it will show you your rating and review and the option to change your review
- Or you could go to My Movies Tab and hit refresh
- In Search movies, you can also add a movie to the database if you search for a movie that isn't in the database now
- You can try that, but be prepared with the movie's director and short objective description
